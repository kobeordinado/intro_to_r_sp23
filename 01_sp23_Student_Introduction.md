# A little about me:

I am Kobe Ordinado. I am currently a Senior OTM student at the Pamplin
School of Business at the University of Portland. My expected graduate
date is May 2023. Post-graduation I plan to pursue a career in Project
Management or Technology Management. In my free time I like to hang out
with friends, watch movies and tv shows, golf, and play basketball.
Introduction to R will be my first coding language class and I am
excited to learn about how I can make R a useful tool for modern
problems in the business world today.
